## How it all started

    Back in 2020 , I set out to create a website to showcase my work and skills as a front-end developer.
After researching and trying out different tools, I landed on using React, Next.js, Three.js, and Framer Motion. 
These tools have proven to be invaluable in helping me create engaging and interactive websites.

    When I first started creating my website, I chose to use React Native. However, as I continued to develop and gain experience, I found that Next.js was better suited for my needs. 
The framework's server-side rendering and automatic code splitting allowed for improved performance and faster load times, ultimately enhancing the user experience.

## The first iteration

    React has allowed me to create reusable components, making it easier to maintain and update my code. 
With Next.js, I am able to build server-side rendered applications, providing faster load times and better SEO. 
Three.js has been essential in creating 3D visualizations and animations, adding a new level of depth and interactivity to my websites. 
And Framer Motion has made it easier to create complex animations and transitions, adding a layer of polish to my designs.

## Migrating to Next.js

- The site is now based on Next.js. Is a much better fit than Create React App. For now I'm just using it to create a static export, but maybe I'll add some server rendered stuff in the future.
- Styling is now vanilla CSS with postcss to add support for the future native CSS nesting and custom media queries features. I'm using CSS modules instead of BEM syntax to avoid style conflicts.
- For generating pages from `.mdx` files, I'm using Kent C Dodds' [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler). In combination with Next.js it makes generating pages from `.mdx` files really quick and simple.
- For animation Framer Motion.
- 3D effects are all using Three.js.

## Not all smooth sailing

    Through working on various projects, I have gained experience and improved my skills with these tools. 
I have also found that the React ecosystem provides a wealth of resources and community support, making it easier to learn and grow.

While these tools have been integral to my work as a front-end developer, I also have experience with other design tools such as Blender and Photoshop. 
These tools have allowed me to create and manipulate 3D models, as well as design and edit images and graphics.

    As a constantly evolving field, I am always eager to learn and incorporate new tools and techniques into my work. 
Overall, I believe that my use of React, Next.js, Three.js, Framer Motion, Blender, and Photoshop has allowed me to create engaging and dynamic websites that showcase my skills as a front-end developer.
